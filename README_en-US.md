## Usage

If you are not familiar with the LaTeX compilation process, please follow the instructions below to compile the document. Before compiling, you need to install the latest TeXLive distribution.

### Compile with Editors

#### VS Code

Install the "LaTeX Workshop" extension, select the preset recipe `Recipe: latexmk (xelatex)` to compile; you can also change `latex-workshop.latex.recipe.default` to `latexmk (xelatex)` in the settings to set it as the default option.

#### TeXstudio

The template has built-in TeXstudio magic comments, can be used out of the box.

### Compile with Scripts

#### Linux & macOS

It is recommended to use GNU make utility with `Makefile` provided in the template.

```bash
make all                      # compile and generate main.pdf
make clean                    # remove useless files
make cleanall                 # remove everything produced by make all
make wordcount                # count the words of the thesis
```

#### Windows

We also provided a batch script `Compile.bat` for Windows users. You can double-click the batch file to compile instantly, or use it in Command Prompt to access extra features.

```bash
.\Compile.bat thesis          # compile and generate main.pdf
.\Compile.bat clean           # remove useless files
.\Compile.bat cleanall        # remove everything produced by make all
.\Compile.bat wordcount       # count the words of the thesis
```

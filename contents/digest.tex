  An imperial edict issued in 1896 by Emperor Guangxu, established Nanyang
  Public School in Shanghai. The normal school, school of foreign studies,
  middle school and a high school were established. Sheng Xuanhuai, the person
  responsible for proposing the idea to the emperor, became the first president
  and is regarded as the founder of the university.

  During the 1930s, the university gained a reputation of nurturing top
  engineers. After the foundation of People's Republic, some faculties were
  transferred to other universities. A significant amount of its faculty were
  sent in 1956, by the national government, to Xi'an to help build up Xi'an Jiao
  Tong University in western China. Afterwards, the school was officially
  renamed Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

  Since the reform and opening up policy in China, SJTU has taken the lead in
  management reform of institutions for higher education, regaining its vigor
  and vitality with an unprecedented momentum of growth. SJTU includes five
  beautiful campuses, Xuhui, Minhang, Luwan Qibao, and Fahua, taking up an area
  of about 3,225,833 m2. A number of disciplines have been advancing towards the
  top echelon internationally, and a batch of burgeoning branches of learning
  have taken an important position domestically.

  Today SJTU has 31 schools (departments), 63 undergraduate programs, 250
  masters-degree programs, 203 Ph.D. programs, 28 post-doctorate programs, and
  11 state key laboratories and national engineering research centers.

  SJTU boasts a large number of famous scientists and professors, including 35
  academics of the Academy of Sciences and Academy of Engineering, 95 accredited
  professors and chair professors of the "Cheung Kong Scholars Program" and more
  than 2,000 professors and associate professors.

  Its total enrollment of students amounts to 35,929, of which 1,564 are

  University has inherited the old tradition of "high starting points, solid
  foundation, strict requirements and extensive practice." Students from SJTU
  have won top prizes in various competitions, including ACM International
  Collegiate Programming Contest, International Mathematical Contest in Modeling
  and Electronics Design Contests. Famous alumni include Jiang Zemin, Lu Dingyi,
  Ding Guangen, Wang Daohan, Qian Xuesen, Wu Wenjun, Zou Taofen, Mao Yisheng,
